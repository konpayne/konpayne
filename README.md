## About Me

I am an ex-marine biologist turned statistician. Seems like an odd jump but I specialized in data analysis for marine protected areas, so now I do similar work but on different datasets. I am driven by curiousity and the desire to fully understand a dataset when presented with one, so that I can unlock all the secrets and information hidden within. Previously, I worked on quantifying the effects of California MPAs on fish population growth and health with the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program. Now I am earning my Master's in Statistics while working for one of my professors on improving small area estimation models with clustering. I hope after graduation to combine my statistical anaylsis skills with my biological background to contribute to data driven innovations.
